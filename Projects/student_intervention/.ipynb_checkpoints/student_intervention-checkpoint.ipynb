In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "    -  Easy and fast to implement\n",
    "    -  Easy to understand\n",
    "    -  Can be used for online learning\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:**\n",

    "    -  Suffers from irrelevant features\n",
    "    -  Strong feature indepence assumptions\n",

    "    - Naive Bayes is very simple and very cheap in terms of computation and, since it is good with small datasets for training I thing it is a good candidate to solve our problem.\n",

    "#### Ensemble Methods - Random Forest ####\n",
    "- Applications include classification of internet traffic, bioinformatics like , gene expression classification, mass spectrum protein expression analysis, biomarker discovery, sequence annotation, protein-protein interaction prediction. \n",
    "- **Strengths:**\n",
    "    - Classification tree ensembles perform very well in practice. They are robust to outliers, scalable, and able to naturally model non-linear decision boundaries thanks to their hierarchical structure.\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "    -  Difficult to interpret\n",
    "    -  Weaker on regression whe estimating values at the extremities of the distribution of response values\n",
    "    -  Biased in multiclass problems toward more frequent classes\n",
    "- **Applicability: **\n",
    "    - Decision trees are very good in classification problems, and using Random Forest we have more consistent results. Since random forest will create a bunch of random decision trees, it can deal with these results to pick the best. Another point is that in our case, we didn't even create the dummy variables because random forest is able to work with discrete and categorical variables. Besides that, random forest is not prone to overfit the model like a single decision tree.\n",

    "#### Logistic Regression ####\n",
    "- Applications include ordering results by probability, modelling marketing responses.\n",

    "- **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "    - Logistic regression tends to underperform when there are multiple or non-linear decision boundaries. They are not flexible enough to naturally capture more complex relationships.\n",

The Random Forest has a bigger training time, but it seems very fast in prediction time with high train and test F1 scores. Beyond that, RandomForestClassifier has many hyperparameters to tuning the algorithm."

    "**Answer: ** Random Forest is just a bunch of decision trees. Decision tree is an algorithm that make simple questions in order to categorize the data. For example, if a bank needs to decide whether to lend money to a customer, it will check its historical data and start to make a serie of questions. Based on answers the bank can conclude if it will lend money or not.\n",
    "However trust in a single decision tree could be a weak decision. Then we used Random Forest, that I said before, it is a bunch of decision trees. The algorithm combine many trees to get a better result. The bunch of decision trees are generated randomly. In our case we have a dataset with 30 features. Not all features are used in each of decision trees. Let's suppose that you use 20% of features of each decision tree. That means the algorithm will select randomly 6 features for each tree. This technique guarantees to train the data in numerous different decision trees. With the results of this series of decision trees, the algorithm can decide the best classification for specific input. The decision is made by vote. For example: we run the algorithm with 100 decision trees. A specific student was classified as \"passed\" in 85 decision trees and \"not passed\" in 15 trees. In this case, the majority vote for this student is \"passed\" and that is the result of the algorithm."
